    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action-rpg game developed and published by CD Projekt Red in 2015.<br />
        It is inspired from fantasy novels written by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The world of witcher <br />
        can be described as middle age with magic and monsters. Magic came to this world by
        <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Conjunction_of_the_Spheres">conjunction of the spheres</a><br />
        and it created monsters. So, people needed someone to fight with these monsters. What did they do you
        might ask.<br />
        They took orphan boys and trained them to be warriors. They made them go through intense alchemical
        processes,<br /> filled their bodies with mutagens and magic to make them more powerful than a normal
        human.<br /> But the proccess was too harsh for young boys and only three out of ten was capable to live,<br />
        others died in the proccess.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        They trained them to become ruthless, soulles killers and after some time they started to spit on them<br />
        and called them freaks as if it wasn't them in the first place who created this. Witchers are extremely
        powerful<br />
        fighters who paid in coin to do dirty work of humans. They lack of emotions as a result of the proccess.<br />
        They use two swords; one silver and for monsters, and one steel for those who are stupid enough to attack<br />
        an armed witcher. They know a lot about alchemy; they can make potions, bombs and oils to have a chance to
        survive<br />
        against numerous monsters and creatures they encounter.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Our main character in the game is a wolf school trained witcher Geralt of Rivia. He is the main character
        in<br /> all three witcher games. The story began as Geralt is on a trail of his ex lover Yennefer of
        Vengerberg<br /> to hope to find a clue about his daughter Cirilla who has the ruthless elven riders the Wild
        Hunt trying<br />
        to catch her. Without spoiling anything I can say that story is very powerful and can make you tear up in<br />
        some points.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Quests in the game are very well designed too. A small quest you think would end up in 10 mins can lead a
        tragic<br /> story where you find darkness of human nature and realize that you're in a world full of
        mystery and evil.<br /> There are some side quests better than main quests and some characters you won't forget
        even after the game is<br /> finished.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        The world of witcher is also full of interesting places to discover. Some sights makes you stop and just watch
        the game.<br /> Listening the sound of nature, watching the huge city walls in sunset and some scenes seems like
        they came<br /> out of a painting. So, to conclude The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the unique experiences you
        might have.<br />
