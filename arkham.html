        Bros.<br />
        Interactive Entertainment in 2015. It is the third game of the Arkham Trilogy. The game takes place in a
        fictional city called Gotham.<br /> Gotham is a city full of problems; most of the citizens live in poverty
        line, streets are full with homeless people and most importantly<br />
        it is ruled by gangs and criminals. Yes, there are politicians who represents the city and yes there are people
        who serves under the law<br /> and rule the city. But, anyone can be bought even the ones who took an oath to
        serve and protect you. However there is someone who<br /> only works for justice, someone who came out at night,
        a caped crusader, a detective, a billionare...<br />
        The Dark Knight of the Gotham City, Batman.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Batman is a character who is way older than most of us. It first came out in Detective Comics 27th issue in May
        1939. Has seen a world<br /> war, space race, fall of the USSR and Covid-19. It is a character who is known for
        generations. He was born in a very rich family and<br /> lived his life in happines until a dreadful night at
        the Gotham City Opera House. Both of his parents were murdered that day for only few bucks.<br /> After that
        he was never the same. He was raised by family butler Alfred Pennyworth. In time he realized something that the
        city needed<br /> someone. He realized if someone was there at that night at the opera, his parents would be
        alive. He promised himself that he will become the<br /> justice that city needs. He used his wealth to the
        benefit of the city. He used it to make himself powerfull so that people can fear him. Mafia<br />bosses start
        to make their meetings in day light, drug dealers wasn't working after dark and when people see that white light
        in the clouds they<br /> knew someone is at the roofs, watching, protecting.

        In Arkham Knight you play as Batman. The game starts with a nice restaurant. An officer drinking his evening
        coffee while reading some news<br /> then a citizen came in and says there is someone at the back smoking in
        closed area which is prohibited in Gotham. So, officer walks to the stranger<br /> and tells him to put out the
        cigarette. Then hell happens. People start to attack each other, plates start to fly in the air and chaos
        everywhere.<br /> The interesting thing that people didn't know about this incident was, it wasn't just couple
        of
        people fighting. It was the result of the very small<br /> amount of toxic gas that released in to the
        restaurant by
        Scarecrow, a villain that Batman had been dealing with for a long time. After the incident at the<br />
        restaurant Scarecrow released a video about the things he can do to the city with his new formula and warned the
        citizens of Gotham City. After the video<br /> police start to evacuate the city. Within couple of hours city
        streets became soulles except the people who enjoyes this caos; criminals.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Your duty as the Batman is to find Scarecrow, end this caos and solve the mystery about the new guy named Arkham
        Knight who works for Scarecrow.<br /> The game gives you couple of gadgets and also first time in the series
        the Batmobile. Batmobile is a vehicle which is technically a tank. It can resist<br /> extreme amount of
        pressure and heat. Gameplay of the game is just beautiful. Roaming in the city with the Batmobile and bolting
        into the air like a bullet<br /> from the car seamlessly. Fighting mechanics are also very good and makes you
        feel like Batman. Gliding between buildings, trying to solve Riddler's puzzles,<br /> roaming in the streets,
        kicking some bad guys' asses. Batman Arkham Knight is one of the best games I have ever played in last decade.
        If you are a fan of<br />Batman give it a shot, it's worth it.
