    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game developed by Rockstar Studios and published by Rockstar Games in 2019(PC).<br />
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in 1899 USA. Cowboys' age has gone and Lawmen has more power than ever <br />
        before. Railroads connecting the country and taking law to every town thus making it harder to be an
        outlaw.<br />
        In this age of changes you play as an outlaw named Arthur Morgan. Arthur is in his middle 30s and<br />
        has seen some pretty bad things happen and did some pretty bad things. The game starts at a time when you<br />
        and your gang were chased by law forces after a failed heist. You try to make your trail dissappear<br />
        by going over mountains through heavy blizzard. After some events in the early gameplay the game opens<br />
        it's doors to it's massive open world.
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        Red Dead Redemption 2 has the most living open world to date. Every person you see has a personality,<br />
        a job, a daily routine. They talk to each other, fight, drink, go to do their work. Some of them work<br />
        in ranches some in bars some in banks. Each and every one of them feels like they're alive. Like they<br />
        are more than 0s and 1s. The engine is also one of the most realistic engine ever. Every move, <br />
        every step has a weight and makes you feel you are in a breathing, living world.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">
        There are more than 200 species of animals in Red Dead Redemption 2. Each one has it's own attitude each<br />
        responses differently to your actions. Also, the world itself is alive every second; a mountain lion<br />
        trying to hunt a whitetail buck, a rabbit catched by an eagle or two male bucks fighting for dominance.<br />
        The world is full of life, full of action and full of stories to discover.<br />
        To sum up, Red Dead Redemption 2 is by far the best game I've ever played in last ten years.
