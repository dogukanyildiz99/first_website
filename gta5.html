        Quest are very well designed and uses the map in every possible way. Each one is feels different and makes you
        sit and play the game<br /> for hours. Open world is also full of activities too. You can be a paparazzi and try
        to get shots of the celebrities. Or, you can be an<br />
        assassin shoot some high end people and make your money out of it. Or, you can just play golf, ride bikes, swim,
        do yoga and race in<br /> high speeds. You can do whatever you want as much as the game allows you. So, simply
        take your car, turn on the Non Stop Pop FM<br /> and ride to sunset by the sea or just do a massacare. This is
        GTA V.
